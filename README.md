An MEG Experiment to study the effect of attention on neural responses to high frequency channels aligned with the frequency of the fricatives.
Use decoding function to see whehter attention is decodable for a given conditions.

# Jupyter notebook
See the _**Sample_Analysis**_ notebook for examples on functions.
